# Javascript-Tryouts
Repository where I upload some projects in javascript, mostly using P5js

Please check out the wiki for more information on individual projects.
The p5js libraries are required to run almost every project so I would suggest to download the whole repository.
To run a project, simply open the index.html file in a browser.

Hope you enjoy!
